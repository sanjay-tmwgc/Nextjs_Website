            <div className="flowthree-para">
              <p>
                Life insurance and annuities offer significant tax benefits that
                can help you maximize your savings and minimize your tax
                liability. With life insurance, the death benefit is typically
                paid out to your beneficiaries tax-free, providing them with
                financial security without the burden of taxes.
              </p>
              <p>
                Similarly, annuities offer tax-deferred growth, meaning you
                won't pay taxes on your earnings until you start receiving
                income. This allows your retirement savings to grow faster and
                gives you more control over when you pay taxes.
              </p>
              <p>
                At Sky Financial, we can help you take advantage of these tax
                benefit programs and create a comprehensive financial strategy
                that minimizes your tax liability while maximizing your savings
                potential.

                  Determining your life insurance needs depends on various
